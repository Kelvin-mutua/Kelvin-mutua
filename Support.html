<h1>Support - Sales Reporting System</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This support page provides information on how to use the Sales Reporting System, including how to add sales, generate reports, and understand the data presented in those reports.</p>

<h2>Using the Sales Page</h2>
<p>The Sales Page allows you to input items sold and finalize sales transactions. Hereâ€™s how to use it:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Adding Items:</strong> You can either scan a QR code or type the item name in the input field. You can also select an item from the dropdown menu.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Section:</strong> Select the payment method (Cash, Credit Card, Mobile Payment) and enter the amount received from the customer.</li>
    <li><strong>Finalize Sale:</strong> Click the "Finalize Sale" button to complete the transaction. This will store the sale data in local storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Generating Reports</h2>
<p>Once you have finalized sales, you can view reports based on the sales data stored in local storage. The following report options are available:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Daily Report:</strong> This report shows all sales made on the current day. It includes the report number, date of sale, payment method used, items sold, and total amount.</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly Report:</strong> This report summarizes all sales made in the current month, providing similar details as the daily report.</li>
    <li><strong>Sales Summary Report:</strong> This report displays all sales data stored in local storage, giving a comprehensive overview of all transactions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Report Details</h2>
<p>Each report contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Report Number:</strong> A unique identifier for each report generated.</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Sale:</strong> The date when the sale occurred.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Method Used:</strong> The method of payment selected during the sale (Cash, Credit Card, Mobile Payment).</li>
    <li><strong>Items Sold:</strong> A list of items that were part of the transaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Total Amount:</strong> The total sales amount for that transaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Q: What should I do if there is no sales data available?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you see a message indicating that no sales data is available, ensure that you have finalized at least one sale on the Sales Page.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I clear the sales data?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can clear the local storage data through your browser's developer tools. However, this will permanently delete all sales records.</p>
